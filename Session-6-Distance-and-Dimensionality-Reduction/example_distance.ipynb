election is about the crisis of living standards\",\"and the climate and environmental emergency.\",\"Whether we are ready or not, we stand on the brink of unstoppable change.\",\"We must confront this change while dealing with the growing inequality and insecurity in Britain.\",\"Labour led the UK Parliament in declaring a climate and environmental emergency.\",\"The next Labour government will lead the world in fighting it, with a plan to drive up living standards by transforming our economy into one low in carbon,\",\"The climate crisis ties us all into a common fate.\",\"This election is our best hope to protect future generations from an uninhabitable planet.\",\"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said we need to cut global emissions in half by 2030 to have a chance of keeping global heating within safe limits \\u2013 that means acting now, and acting decisively.\",\"The Tories wasted a decade serving the interests of big polluters.\",\"Labour will use the crucial next decade to act.\",\"The Tories slashed support for renewable energy while pushing through dangerous fracking.\",\"Now Britain is decades off course on vital emissions targets.\",\"That\\u2019s why Labour will kick-start a Green Industrial Revolution\",\"that will create one million jobs in the UK\",\"to transform our industry, energy, transport, agriculture and our buildings\",\"Our Green New Deal aims to achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based,\",\"just and that delivers an economy that serves the interests of the many, not the few.\",\"Just as the original Industrial Revolution brought industry, jobs and pride to our towns, Labour\\u2019s world-leading Green Industrial Revolution will rebuild them,\",\"with more rewarding, well-paid jobs,\",\"and whole new industries to revive parts of our country that have been neglected for too long.\",\"For some, industrial transition has become a byword for devastation, because successive Conservative governments were content to sit back and leave the fate of whole industries and communities at the mercy of market forces.\",\"A Labour government will never let that happen.\",\"We will work in partnership with the workforce and their trade unions in every sector of our economy, so that they lead the transition in their industries,\",\"creating new, good-quality jobs\",\"and making sure that their extensive skills are passed on to the next generation of workers.\",\"We will show the world how prioritising sustainability will not only deliver immediate improvements to everyone\\u2019s lives but also offer humanity a pathway to a more equitable and enlightened economy:\",\"one that protects our environment,\",\"builds international solidarity\",\"and promises a better quality of life for all.\",\"The scale of the challenge requires nothing less.\",\"Tackling the destruction of our planet is a question of justice \\u2013 for the communities at home and abroad who are most affected by it and for our children who will bear the consequences if we don\\u2019t.\",\"Social justice will define Labour\\u2019s approach.\",\"We will make sure that the costs of the green transition fall fairly and are mostly borne by the wealthy and those most responsible for the problem.\",\"2019 saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up and act on the climate and environmental emergency.\",\"Labour welcomed that movement and, as a government in waiting, we have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change.\",\"Delivering the far-reaching change needed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency will require a full mobilisation of national resources, both public and private.\",\"Labour will create a Sustainable Investment Board to bring together the Chancellor, Business Secretary and Bank of England Governor to oversee, co-ordinate and bring forward this investment \\u2013 involving trade unions and business.\",\"We will ask the Office for Budget Responsibility to incorporate climate and environmental impacts into its forecasts so that the cost of not acting will be factored into every fiscal decision.\",\"The cost of not acting is far greater than the cost of acting.\",\"We will launch a National Transformation Fund of \\u00a3400 billion\",\"and rewrite the Treasury\\u2019s investment rules to guarantee that every penny spent is compatible with our climate and environmental targets \\u2013\",\"and that the costs of not acting are fully accounted for too.\",\"Of this, \\u00a3250 billion will directly fund the transition through a Green Transformation Fund dedicated to renewable and low-carbon energy and transport,\",\"biodiversity and environmental restoration.\",\"We will create a National Investment Bank, backed up by a network of Regional Development Banks, to provide \\u00a3250 billion of lending for enterprise,\",\"infrastructure and innovation over 10 years.\",\"They will be mandated to lend in line with our mission to decarbonise our economy\",\"and creating good jobs across the country.\",\"As well as large-scale national and regional projects, smaller loans will be available through our new Post Bank based in Post Office branches, enabling thousands of bottom-up transformational changes by start-ups, small businesses, local co-operatives and community projects in towns and villages up and down the country.\",\"We will make sure that the UK\\u2019s financial sector is helping to tackle the emergency rather than fuelling it.\",\"We will do this by improving the fitness of our financial authorities to mobilise green investment\",\"and by giving them powers to manage the risk to financial stability posed by short-sighted investment in polluting assets.\",\"Just 100 companies globally are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions.\",\"We won\\u2019t be afraid to tackle this wanton corporate destruction by taking on the powerful interests that are causing climate change.\",\"We will change the criteria a company must meet to be listed

resources, both financial and human.\",\"But we will only succeed by ensuring that everyone shares in the benefits.\",\"Labour will make sure that investment is spread evenly across the whole country and will give powers and funding to every region and nation of the UK.\",\"We will bring about a radical decentralisation of power in Britain so that local people and communities are given far greater control over their own lives and prospects.\",\"A Local Transformation Fund in each English region will be used exclusively to fund infrastructure projects decided at a local level,\",\"as will devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\",\"Our Regional Development Banks will be governed by boards made up of key local stakeholders such as local chambers of commerce, trade unions and councillors \\u2013\",\"with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland empowered to make similar arrangements.\",\"They will set priorities for lending, giving every region and nation a new and powerful lever to rebuild their economy on their own terms.\",\"We will shift the political centre of gravity by placing the National Transformation Fund Unit, a key part of the Treasury, in the North of England\",\"and build up the regional offices of government in each of the nine English regions to co-ordinate government policies at the regional level,\",\"as well as ensuring a regional voice in Whitehall.\",\"Energy use in buildings accounts for 56% of the UK\\u2019s total emissions, making it the single most polluting sector.\",\"We will develop the recommendations of our \\u201830 by 2030\\u2019 report to put the UK on track for a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s \\u2013\",\"We will deliver nearly 90% of electricity and 50% of heat from renewable and low-carbon

immediately and permanently ban fracking.\",\"We will support energy workers through transition and guarantee them retraining\",\"and a new, unionised job on equivalent terms and conditions.\",\"We will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies, so that the companies that knowingly damaged our climate will help cover the costs.\",\"We will provide a strategy to safeguard the people, jobs and skills that depend on the offshore oil and gas industry.\",\"We will not achieve the promise of a fair and sustainable economy if we repeat the mistakes of the carbon era, when the capture of a natural resource for private profit created a vastly unequal and polluting economy dominated by powerful vested interests.\",\"From the depletion of fish stocks to the burning of the Amazon, profit has proved a poor regulator for use of our natural resources.\",\"Whether it is the trillions of litres of water lost through leakages,\",\"barriers to renewable energy connecting to the grid\",\"or the billions of pounds of bill- payers\\u2019 money being siphoned off in dividends to wealthy shareholders,\",\"Tory privatisation of our utilities has been a disaster for both our planet and our wallets.\",\"We will put people and planet before profit by bringing our energy and water systems into democratic public ownership.\",\"In public hands, energy and water will be treated as rights rather than commodities,\",\"with any surplus reinvested or used to reduce bills.\",\"Communities themselves will decide, because utilities won\\u2019t be run from Whitehall but by service-users and workers.\",\"Public ownership will secure democratic control over nationally strategic infrastructure\",\"and provide collective stewardship for key natural resources.\",\"In the case of energy, it will also help deliver Labour\\u2019s ambitious emissions targets.\",\"Whereas private network companies have failed to upgrade the grid at the speed and scale needed,\",\"publicly owned networks will accelerate and co-ordinate investment to connect renewable and low-carbon energy\",\"while working with energy unions to support energy workers through the transition.\",\"Under Labour\\u2019s plans: A new UK National Energy Agency will own and maintain the national grid infrastructure and oversee the delivery of our decarbonisation targets.\",\"14 new Regional Energy Agencies will replace the existing district network operators\",\"and hold statutory responsibility for decarbonising electricity and heat\",\"The supply arms of the Big Six energy companies will be brought into public ownership where they will continue to supply households with energy\",\"while helping them to reduce their energy demands.\",\"The Conservatives allowed the proceeds of North Sea oil to be squandered on tax cuts for the richest\",\"and captured in profits for the few, instead of investing them in our future.\",\"We now stand at an even greater crossroads in the development of our national economy.\",\"Under Labour, our green future will be owned by all of us.\",\"Whenever public money is invested in an energy generation project, the public sector will take a stake and return profits to the public.\",\"Averting climate catastrophe offers huge economic opportunities.\",\"But Britain will only benefit from a Green Industrial Revolution with the right policies.\",\"Over the past three decades, Britain has reduced its emissions at the expense of domestic industry by offshoring production.\",\"This is an accounting trick, not a solution.\",\"It does not protect the climate\",\"and it damages jobs and communities at home\",\"Labour will take full responsibility for our carbon footprint instead of passing the buck.\",\"We will instruct the Committee on Climate Change to assess the emissions the UK imports as well as those it produces, and recommend policies to tackle them,\",\"including making UK industry the greenest in the world.\",\"The Conservatives have presided over a lost decade of productivity and allowed Britain to fall behind in the green technologies of the future.\",\"Labour will make sure this never happens again.\",\"Targeted science, research and innovation will be crucial to tackling the climate crisis,\",\"dealing with the plastic waste filling our oceans\",\"and addressing other societal challenges, such as an ageing population\",\"As part of our plan to usher in a Green Industrial Revolution, Labour will create an innovation nation, setting a target for 3% of GDP to be spent on research and development (R&D) by 2030.\",\"We will

Sector Council to provide a clean and long-term future for our existing heavy industries like steel and glass\",\"and fund R&D into newer technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\",\"A thriving steel industry will be vital to the Green Industrial Revolution.\",\"Labour will support our steel through public procurement,\",\"taking action on industrial energy prices, exempting new capital from business rates\",\"building three new steel recycling plants\",\"and upgrading existing production sites.\",\"We will ensure that new technologies aren\\u2019t just invented here, but are engineered, manufactured and exported from here.\",\"We will put British innovation at the heart of our procurement to support local sourcing and reshoring, so that every investment we make strengthens our manufacturing and engineering sectors and supply chains\",\"and creates hundreds of thousands of good, unionised jobs here at home.\",\"We will use the power of public procurement to strengthen local jobs and supply chains\",\"and will require all companies bidding for public contracts to recognise trade unions,\",\"and demonstrate equalities best practice.\",\"As we transition, we will ensure the UK\\u2019s automotive sector isn\\u2019t left behind by the electric revolution by investing in three new gigafactories\",\"and four metal reprocessing plants.\",\"By supporting UK-made electrical steel we will ensure robust support for an end to end UK supply chain.\",\"We\\u2019ll also take on the global plastics crisis by investing in a new plastics

unable to spend.\",\"And it is not delivering for small businesses.\",\"We cannot afford to carry on like this.\",\"Labour will make it easier for employers to spend the levy by allowing it to be used for a wider range of accredited training, in line with guidelines set by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education and government\\u2019s wider priorities for the economy.\",\"We will launch a Climate Apprenticeship programme to enable employers to develop the skills needed to lead the world in clean technology.\",\"Under this programme, employers will be expected to allocate 25% of the funds in their Apprenticeship Levy accounts to training Climate Apprentices.\",\"These funds can be spent directly or allocated to a ring-fenced Climate Apprenticeship Fund, which will be topped up with any surplus raised through Inclusive Ownership Funds and made accessible to non- levy-paying businesses.\",\"Targeted bursaries will be available to women,\",\"to encourage them to take up climate apprenticeships \\u2013 the STEM of the future.\",\"We will further help small businesses by increasing the amount that can be transferred to non-levy-paying employers to 50%\",\"and introducing an online matching service to help levy-paying businesses find smaller businesses to transfer their funds to.\",\"Labour will build a sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system,  founded on the principle that transport is an essential public service.\",\"Cutting emissions will drive our transport policies.\",\"We will review public expenditure on transport to ensure that it promotes environmental sustainability and contributes to decarbonisation.\",\"Bus services have been devastated by the Conservatives, despite carrying more people than any other mode of public transport.\",\"Women are especially dependent on buses, which also provide a lifeline for both older and younger people and for many economically disadvantaged groups.\",\"Labour will ensure that councils can improve bus services by regulating and taking public ownership of bus networks,\",\"and we will give them resources and full legal powers to achieve this cost-effectively,\",\"thereby ending the race to the bottom in working conditions for bus workers.\",\"Where councils take control of their buses, Labour will introduce free bus travel for under-25s.\",\"We will increase and expand local services, reinstating the 3,000 routes that have been cut, particularly hitting rural communities.\",\"Labour will deliver improvements for rail passengers by bringing our railways back into public ownership, using options including franchise expiry.\",\"This will enable us to make fares simpler and more affordable,\",\"rebuild the fragmented railways as a nationally integrated public service,\",\"cut the wastage of private profit,\",\"improve accessibility for disabled people,\",\"ensure safe staffing levels and end driver-only operation.\",\"Our publicly owned rail company will steer network planning and investments.\",\"It will co-ordinate mainline upgrades, resignalling, rolling stock replacement and major projects.\",\"We will implement a full, rolling programme of electrification.\",\"Our model will ensure continuity of skills,\",\"and supply chain capacity to reduce costs,\",\"and support the economic benefits of Labour\\u2019s Green Industrial Revolution.\",\"We will introduce a long-term investment plan including delivering Crossrail for the North as part of improved connectivity across the northern regions.\",\"We will consult with local communities to reopen branch lines.\",\"We will also unlock capacity and extend high-speed rail networks nationwide by completing the full HS2

and will continue to grow.\",\"We will help SMEs to become exporters, so that they can seize the opportunities that will become available once we get Brexit done.\",\"Good regulation is essential to successful businesses:\",\"we will strive to achieve the right regulatory balance between supporting excellent business practice\",\"Through our Red Tape Challenge, we will ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate,\",\"and that we always consider the needs of small businesses when devising new rules,\",\"using our new freedom after Brexit to ensure that British rules work for British companies.\",\"As well as encouraging investment in physical building and equipment,\",\"\\uf02fwe will help employers invest in skills\",\"and look at how we can improve the working of the Apprenticeship Levy.\",\"Every day, people risk their savings and their future by becoming entrepreneurs.\",\"They invent the new goods and services that improve our lives.\",\"From decarbonisation to expanding the frontiers of artificial intelligence, they are tackling some of the great challenges of our time.\",\"We want to be a nation of start-ups, and of successful scale-ups.\",\"We have more \\u2018unicorns\\u2019 \\u2013 new billion-dollar tech companies \\u2013 than any other nation in Europe.\",\"We are proud of the work we have done to support entrepreneurship and want to see more entrepreneurs,\",\"including women and those from BAME backgrounds.\",\"Some of our work has been spectacularly successful \\u2013 such as the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Enterprise Investment Scheme, which we will continue in the next Parliament.\",\"And by cutting corporation tax from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, we have encouraged more businesses to invest and grow in the UK.\",\"Some measures have worked, but need to go further \\u2013 as with R&D tax credits.\",\"We will increase the tax credit rate to 13 per cent\",\"and review the definition of R&D so that important investments in cloud computing and data, which boost productivity and innovation, are also incentivised.\",\"We also have to recognise that some measures haven\\u2019t fully delivered on their objectives.\",\"So we will review and reform Entrepreneur\\u2019s Relief.\",\"Of course, supporting enterprise is not just about championing businesses \\u2013 more people than ever are moving into self-employment, especially women.\",\"We will therefore launch a review to explore how we can better support the self-employed.\",\"That includes improving their access to finance and credit (not least mortgages),\",\"making the tax system easier to navigate,\",\"and examining how better broadband can boost home-working.\",\"Conservatives believe in a corporate tax system which rewards entrepreneurship\",\"We will always be whole-heartedly on the side of business,\",\"while making sure everyone pays their fair share of tax.\",\"Already, the top 1 per cent of income taxpayers pay over 29 per cent of income tax\\u2013 higher than at any time under the last Labour Government.\",\"We will continue to build on this to tackle tax evasion\",\"and reduce opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance.\",\"Since 2010, we have introduced more than 100 anti-avoidance measures\",\"and secured more than \\u00a3200 billion which would otherwise have gone unpaid \\u2013 \\u00a324 billion in the last year alone.\",\"We have led the international fight against aggressive tax avoidance and offshore tax havens, rewriting global rules to ensure tax is paid where profit is made.\",\"This has included committing 100 jurisdictions to ending bank secrecy.\",\"The gap between the amount of tax that should be paid and is actually collected stands at \\u00a335 billion \\u2013 still too high.\",\"Hard-working families and businesses who do pay their fair share should know that we will not permit evasion to go unchecked.\",\"So we will set out a new anti-tax avoidance and evasion law.\",\"This will: Double the maximum prison term to 14 years for individuals convicted of the most egregious examples of tax fraud.\",\"Create a single, beefed-up Anti-Tax Evasion unit in HMRC that covers all duties and taxes, from individual errors to deliberate non-compliance \\u2013 which is put on a legislative footing.\",\"Consolidate existing anti-evasion and avoidance measures and powers.\",\"Introduce a new package of anti-evasion measures, including measures to end tax abuse in the construction sector,\",\"crack down on illicit tobacco packaging\",\"and further measures to avoid profit-shifting by multinational companies to avoid paying taxes.\",\"Major multinational companies should pay their fair share of tax.\",\"As part of our approach, we will implement the Digital Services Tax.\",\"While always backing entrepreneurs that choose to make the UK the place to invest and set up a business,\",\"we will take further action to redesign the tax system so that it boosts growth,\",\"and limits arbitrary tax advantages for the wealthiest in society.\",\"We are also strengthening the UK\\u2019s corporate governance regime, and will reform insolvency rules and the audit regime so that customers and suppliers \\u2013 and UK taxpayers \\u2013 are better protected when firms like Thomas Cook go into administration.\",\"We will also carefully study the results of the ongoing investigation into its collapse.\",\"We will improve incentives to attack the problem of excessive executive pay and rewards for failure.\",\"We will reintroduce legislation that protects pension pots from being plundered by reckless bosses,\",\"helps savers be better informed with pension dashboards,\",\"and creates a new style of pension scheme which is more sustainable for workers and employers.\",\"The 2020s will see a transformation in jobs.\",\"Automation and computing will change how businesses function.\",\"Our plan to deliver clean energy and a carbon-neutral future means new kinds of jobs in new industries.\",\"And our departure from the European Union means we can develop forward-looking regulations to ensure we are first in line to develop and benefit from the technologies of the future.\",\"This requires a dramatic rebooting of our training system\",\"existing businesses and the businesses of the future.\",\"But above all, we want to ensure that Britain\\u2019s workers have the skills they need to flourish\",\"\\u2013 and that every citizen of this country has the opportunity to express their talents to the fullest.\",\"Since 2010, the Government has invested significantly in technical qualifications and apprenticeships, with 3.8 million more apprenticeships.\",\"In the next Parliament, we expect to train up hundreds of thousands more highly skilled apprentices.\",\"But we will go further and require significant numbers of new UK apprentices for all big new infrastructure projects \\u2013 new hospitals, new schools, major transport projects and so on,\",\"being built with pride by a new generation of British workers.\",\"Whatever age you are, nothing is more Conservative than working hard to improve your lot\",\"and nothing is more important for the Conservative Party than supporting people in those efforts.\",\"Our reforms and investment in education and skills mean more children are leaving school better equipped for working life\",\"and there are more high quality apprenticeships.\",\"But there is much more to do to level up the skills of the entire nation.\",\"Not just to improve Britain\\u2019s productivity,\",\"but to enable people to fulfil their potential.\",\"As the centrepiece of our plan, we will create a new National Skills Fund worth \\u00a33 billion over the next Parliament.\",\"This fund will provide matching funding for individuals and SMEs for high-quality education and training.\",\"A proportion will be reserved for further strategic investment in skills, and we will consult widely on the overall design.\",\"The National Skills Fund will help to transform the lives of people who have not got onto the work ladder and lack qualifications,\",\"as well as people who are keen to return to work from, say, raising a family, or switch from one career to another.\",\"It will not only make this country more prosperous, but fairer.\",\"Just as universities have been transformed by significant long-term investment over the last few decades, we need to make sure local colleges are equally excellent places for people to learn.\",\"We are therefore investing almost \\u00a32 billion to upgrade the entire further education college estate.\",\"And we\\u2019ll also have 20 Institutes of Technology, which connect high-quality teaching in science, technology, engineering and maths to business and industry.\",\"Vitally, leaving the EU also means that we can take back control of the money that was being channelled via its Structural Funds.\",\"We have already announced a UK Shared Prosperity Fund, to ensure that the people of the UK do not lose out from the withdrawal of EU funding\",\"(which was, of course, only a small part of the billions of pounds we were contributing),\",\"and to replace the EU programme with one that is fairer and better tailored to our economy.\",\"And we will ensure that \\u00a3500 million of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund is used to give disadvantaged people the skills they need to make a success of life.\",\"Taken together, this package of measures represents a profound commitment to Britain\\u2019s future \\uf02f\\u2013\",\"to helping people of whatever age and background navigate the new world of work,\",\"equip themselves with the skills they need,\",\"The UK is home to leading universities, which attract students from all over the world, conduct vital research, and generate enormous benefits for our economy and our society.\",\"They also do an excellent job of generating many of the skills that our economy needs, producing globally renowned scientists, entrepreneurs and creators, and enabling millions of people to fulfil their potential.\",\"In the next Parliament we will work to maintain and strengthen our global position in higher education.\",\"The Augar Review made thoughtful recommendations on tuition fee levels, the balance of funding between universities, further education and apprenticeships and adult learning, and we will consider them carefully.\",\"We will look at the interest rates on loan repayments with a view to reducing the burden of debt on students.\",\"We also will continue to explore ways to tackle the problem of grade inflation and low quality courses,\",\"and improve the application and offer system for undergraduate students.\",\"Our approach will be underpinned by a commitment to fairness, quality of learning and teaching, and access.\",\"We will also strengthen academic freedom and free speech in universities\",\"and continue to focus on raising standards.\",\"We will strengthen universities and colleges\\u2019 civic role.\",\"We will invest in local adult education and require the Office for Students to look at universities\\u2019 success in increasing access across all ages, not just young people entering full-time undergraduate degrees.\",\"As well as making Britain the best place to start a business,\",\"and the best place to learn and develop your skills,\",\"we want to make the UK the best place in the world to work.\",\"The increase in employment that the Conservative Government has overseen since 2010 is proof that there is no contradiction between high employment and high standards\",\"\\u2013 between dynamic growth and protecting employees from unfair policies and discriminatory treatment.\",\"Over the last year, for example, unemployment has continued to fall,\",\"even as average real wages have increased.\",\"We have raised the personal income tax allowance,\",\"and introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage to ensure that people get to keep more of what they earn\",\"And we have aimed to strike the right balance between the flexibility that the economy needs and the security that employees deserve,\",\"introducing new protections for workers\",\"while preserving the dynamism and job creation that drive our shared prosperity.\",\"Once we have got Brexit done, we will go further.\",\"Because people cannot fulfil their potential if they do not have jobs that treat them with dignity and respect,\",\"and if they are not in control of their lives and their futures.\",\"As Conservatives we will always prioritise the principle of fairness in the workplace, whether it is in the job application process,\",\"ensuring equal pay for equal work,\",\"or people\\u2019s working conditions.\",\"We scrapped exclusivity clauses in zero hours contracts to give workers more flexibility.\",\"We have already taken forward a number of recommendations from the Taylor Review and will build on existing employment law with measures that protect those in low-paid work and the gig economy.\",\"For example: We will create a single enforcement body and crack down on any employer abusing employment law, whether by taking workers\\u2019 tips or refusing them sick pay.\",\"We will ensure that workers have the right to request a more predictable contract and other reasonable protections.\",\"We also want to look at more radical ways to support working families in the UK.\",\"Our lifestyles have been transformed over the last four decades \\u2013 many families today have two working parents who are juggling work and other responsibilities.\",\"They have to stretch themselves daily to care for children, elderly relatives and those with disabilities.\",\"For women, who still tend to be the main carers in households, this can have a big impact on their careers and limit their participation in the workplace.\",\"But while the modern workplace is adapting as a result, we can do more as a Government to make things easier, learning from sensible approaches adopted in other countries.\",\"We will therefore introduce a raft of measures that balance the needs of employees and employers:\",\"We will encourage flexible working and consult on making it the default unless employers have good reasons not to.\",\"We have reformed redundancy law so companies cannot discriminate against women immediately after returning from maternity leave.\",\"We will legislate to allow parents to take extended leave for neonatal care, to support those new mothers and fathers who need it during the most vulnerable and stressful days of their lives.\",\"And we will look at ways to make it easier for fathers to take paternity leave.\",\"We will extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers, the majority of whom are women, to a week.\",\"Over the last nine years, we have extended the offer of free childcare hours to more working parents.\",\"We know that people value this support, but wish it could be more flexible.\",\"As outlined above, we will fund more high-quality childcare before and after school and during the holidays\",\"so that working parents do not have to choose between their careers and their children.\",\"Our vision for the labour market, in other words, is not one where the state does everything for you.\",\"It is one where the state does everything it can to help you help yourself \\u2013 by upgrading your skills,\",\"or by being able to balance work and family life.\",\"It is one in which a deep commitment to entrepreneurship and business is matched\",\"by a desire to ensure that the jobs that are created are highly skilled, well-paid and fulfilling.\",\"The UK has a proud record of innovation and discovery.\",\"We are the country that gave the world penicillin, the World Wide Web, the theories of gravity and evolution, that unravelled the structure of DNA.\",\"The University of Cambridge alone has played host to more Nobel laureates than have been produced by any country in the world bar the United States.\",\"More, indeed, than France, Japanand China \\u2013 combined.\",\"That spirit of discovery is still alive in this country today.\",\"But we have not always turned our genius for innovation into jobs and companies here in Britain.\",\"EU regulations have been another barrier to innovation.\",\"We need to use science and research to unite and level up our country, giving people opportunity and hope.\",\"Once we have got Brexit done, we will turn our attention to the great challenges of the future such as clean energy and advanced energy storage;\",\"To do this we will make an unprecedented investment in science so we can strengthen research and build the foundations for the new industries of tomorrow.\",\"We are committing to the fastest ever increase in domestic public R&D spending, including in basic science research to meet our target of 2.4 per cent of GDP being spent on R&D across the economy.\",\"Some of this new spending will go to a new agency for high-risk, high-payoff research, at arm\\u2019s length from government.\",\"We will continue to support our outstanding science sector as we leave the EU.\",\"Unlike Corbyn\\u2019s Labour, we will not spend blindly and

investment.\",\"We will support international collaboration and exchange and ensure UK teams can recruit the skills and talent they need from abroad.\",\"We will reform the science funding system to cut the time wasted by scientists filling in forms.\",\"We will unlock long-term capital in pension funds to invest in and commercialise our scientific discoveries,\",\"creating a vibrant science-based economy post-Brexit.\",\"We will continue to collaborate internationally and with the EU on scientific research, including Horizon.\",\"These unprecedented increases to the science budget will be used to drive forward the development of technologies of critical importance to the UK,\",\"by investing in clusters around world-leading universities and spreading knowledge.\",\"But

profit by producing food and fish that are the envy of the world \\u2013 both for their quality and the high standards to which they were produced.\",\"We want people, both at home and abroad, to be
